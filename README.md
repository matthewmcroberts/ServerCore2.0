# ServerCore2.0

ServerCore2.0 is an updated version of the original ServerCore that I personally use on my private testing servers. 
The purpose of ServerCore2.0 is to add essential components to any basic Minecraft server, such as:

### Commands
- /gm
- /msg
- /tp
- /rank
- /give
- /heal
- /punish
- /help

### Player Rank System
A player ranking system that sorts players into a rank 
- (Owner, Dev, Admin, etc.)
- Adds player nametags
- Permissions

### Punishment System (Not finished)
A player punishment system that improves upon the basics that any server are given. 

### Player Settings
Works as a preference system for what a player may want enabled or disabled
